# Calendar Project in C language
The purpose of this part of the lab is to give you practice working with functions. i have both handle ready-made functions and write our own functions that implement simple algorithms. The program you will be developing will build on Robert's 
calendar program at the end of chapter 5, where the extension is that the program also handles the calculation of dates for different holidays, as well as days of the week for dates of birth that its entered by the user. The finished program should also have a simple menu system that allows the user to navigate between different options. As described in the book and discussed in lectures, step-by-step decomposition is an important part of solving this problem well.
The goal is to construct a calendar application, which in addition to displaying a calendar for a whole year, it should also be able to retrieve various calendar information related to holidays and to a a person's date of birth
This project was worked on a group of 3 students.
